# A Leap year falls into steps:

# 1: it at least needs to be able to be cleanly divisible by 4,
# 2: cannot be cleanly divisible by 100/ IF it is, than it must be cleanly divisible by 400

# Non-Leap year steps

# 1: cannot be divisible by 4, if it is than-
# 2: It cannot be cleanly divisible by 100 if it is, than-
# 3: It cannot be cleanly divisible by 400

# all division problems in python end up as a float, whole numbers are represented by a zero in decimal value so I need a way to ensure that the decimal value is zero to determine if its a whole number.





four_year = (year / 4)


hundred_year = (year / 100)

fourhundred_year = (year / 400)
